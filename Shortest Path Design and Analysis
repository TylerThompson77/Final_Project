The shortest path algorithm is used when you have a start point 
and want to find the shortest path to another node. You do not have to go to every 
node. It takes the weight of each path option and calculates what 
the lightest weight path would be.

Design Ideas:
    -Graph Class
        -Probably use an adjancy list(I think the easiest way)
    -Add Node Function
    -Add Edge Function
    -Shortest Path Calculation
        -Take the Start and Ending node and find the cheapest path


Result:
The Shortest path seemed to be much tougher then I had hoped. Your videos did help
but I had to definitley use some online help to make it work. I tried hard to 
incorporate an add node function but I just don't know why it wouldn't work like
my addedge function did.
