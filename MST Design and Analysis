Minimal Spanning Tree or also known as Kruskal's algorithm. This algorith is 
much different then the shortest path algorithm. MST allow you to start at any node. 
It then analyzes the shortest path to each node. You have to visit each 
node. In math class we called it the traveling sales man problem. You have to
find a way to visit each house in the shortest amount of walking.

Design Ideas:
    - Add edge fuinction
    - Add node fuinction
    - Calculate the MSP
    - Show the user which nodes were visited 
    - Show the weight of the MST

Analysis:
Just like the shortest path algorithm the MST proved to be just as difficult.
I tried to not use online help but it was inevitable. I was able to use the add 
edge function but when I tried to incorporate the add node function it just 
would never work.
